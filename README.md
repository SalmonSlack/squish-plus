# Super Mario 64 Co-op Deluxe Squish+ Mod

## 📄 About
Squish+ is an SM64 Co-op Deluxe Mod that expands on the existing squish feature, making it more dynamic, more interactive, and more cartoony! Players can now find themselves squished into a variety of poses, all based on the pose they held the moment they got squashed! New sound effects, new squish physics, and new enemy interactions that will leave players flatter than ever before!

If you are new to SM64 Co-op Deluxe, check out the [Setup Guide!]("") It has step-by-step instructions for getting this mod running on your computer!

If you enjoyed using this mod or want to show support, sharing this or dropping me a comment on my socials to let me know what you think would mean a lot! I may try and make more things like this in the future if people like this one!

Finally, I want to end off this section with a big thanks to `YOU` for checking out this mod! SM64 holds a special place in my heart, and getting to share this with the wonderful community I've found myself a part of is a wonderful feeling.

## 🛠️ Setup Guide (Windows)
1. Download SM64 Co-op DX by clicking the green `Code` button on [the team's official GitHub page]("https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx"), then click `Download ZIP`
2. Extract the ZIP file, and run sm64coopdx.exe. It should notify you that you need an SM64 ROM
3. Obtain a Super Mario 64 ROM
4. Drag the ROM into your SM64 Co-op DX application
5. Download [squish-plus.zip]("") by clicking the download icon towards the right of the page
6. Drag the whole ZIP file into your SM64 Co-op DX application
7. Click the following Menu buttons: `Host -> Mods -> Squish+ -> Back -> Settings -> Skip Intro Cutscene -> Back -> Host`
8. Once you've loaded in, click **D-Pad Down** (Down arrow by default). If Mario squishes, then you're all set!

From here, I suggest [configuring your controls](""), and going to the [official modding page]("https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/") to find some models to mess around with! Or you could even [make your own!]("https://github.com/coop-deluxe/character-template?tab=readme-ov-file#character-templates-for-coop-deluxe") If you enable the pre-installed `Character Select` and `[CS] Extra Characters` mods, you can select the ones you've downloaded and more with the `/char-select` command!

## 🎮 Mod Instructions / Controls
- `D-Pad Down` - ✨ Universal Squish Button ✨ You can use this almost anytime you like! It makes for an easy means of squashing yourself to whatever surfaces you wish, whether there's an enemy around or not to do it for you!
- `A Button` - ✨ Soft Restore Button ✨ This button is how you can organically recover from the `squished` state. You cannot `soft-restore` yourself if you are out of health, have been `squished` for less than 1 second, or if you are underneath a `Surface` object (Thwomp, Whomp, etc).
- `D-Pad Up` - ✨ Hard Restore Button ✨ Use this button if you ever find yourself soft-locked / unable to restore or respawn while in the `squished` state. This acts as an emergency button in case I let a bug slip through 💦

Feel free to use additional mods in tandem with this one! However, I suggest sticking to level mods (such as the pre-installed Star Road mod), or [character mods]("https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/categories/custom-characters.4/"). I've only tested compatibility with a [small handful of behavior mods]("").

If you're able to consistently replicate a bug, don't hesitate to [fill out a bug report]("") with reproduction steps, it helps me a lot! Just make sure to read the [bug reporting guide]("") first!
