## 📄 About
Squish+ is a mod created for SM64 Co-op Deluxe! It expands on the existing squish feature in SM64, making it more dynamic, more interactive, and more cartoony! Players can now find themselves squished into a variety of poses, all based on the pose they were in the moment they got squashed! This mod adds new sound effects, new squish physics, and new enemy interactions that will leave players flatter than ever before! Check out the [trailer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zh6yISxlmxnd6XwUKODs0lXvTOFLVoE-/view?usp=sharing) if you haven't already seen it!

Finally, I want to end off this section with a big thanks to `YOU` for checking out this mod! SM64 holds a special place in my heart, and getting to share this with the wonderful community I've been a part of for so many years is a wonderful feeling!
<br/><br/>

## 🛠️ Setup Guide (Windows)
1. Go to [the team's official GitHub page](https://github.com/coop-deluxe/sm64coopdx/releases/tag/v1.3.2), then scroll to the bottom of the page and download the appropriate version of the game for your system (e.g. `sm64coopdx_Windows_DirectX.zip`)
2. Extract the ZIP file, and run sm64coopdx.exe. It should notify you that you need an SM64 ROM
3. Obtain a Super Mario 64 ROM (I can't legally say where to get one, but just make sure it is a .z64 file)
4. Drag the ROM directly into your SM64 Co-op DX game window
5. Download `squish-plus.zip` from [this page](https://github.com/SalmonSlack/squish-plus/blob/main/squish-plus.zip) by entering `Ctrl-Shift-S` or by clicking the three dots towards the right of the page
6. Drag the whole ZIP file directly into your SM64 Co-op DX game window
7. Click the following Menu buttons: `Host -> Mods -> Squish+ -> Back -> Settings -> Skip Intro Cutscene -> Back -> Host`
8. Once you've loaded in, click **D-Pad Down** (End key by default). If Mario squishes, then you're all set!

Once you verify the mod is working, I recommend setting `Interpolation` to `Fast` by returning to the main menu and clicking `Options -> Display -> Interpolation.` This fixes a lot of visual bugs! From there, I suggest configuring your controls, and going to the [official modding page](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/) to find some fun [character models](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/categories/custom-characters.4/) to mess around with! Or you could even [make your own!](https://github.com/coop-deluxe/character-template?tab=readme-ov-file#character-templates-for-coop-deluxe) If you enable the pre-installed `Character Select` and `[CS] Extra Characters` mods, you can select the ones you've downloaded and more with the in-game `/char-select` command accessed by hitting the `Enter` key!
<br/><br/>

## 🎮 Mod Instructions / Controls
- `D-Pad Down` - ✨ Self Squish Button ✨ You can use this almost anytime you like! It makes for an easy means of squashing yourself to whatever surfaces you wish, whether there's an enemy around or not to do it for you!
  
- `A Button` - ✨ Soft Restore Button ✨ This button is how you can organically recover from the `squished` state. You cannot `soft restore` yourself if you are out of health, have been `squished` for less than a number of seconds, or if you are underneath a `Surface Object` (Thwomp, Whomp, etc).
  
- `D-Pad Up` - ✨ Hard Restore Button ✨ Use this button if you ever find yourself soft-locked / unable to restore or respawn while in the `squished` state. This acts as an emergency button in case you encounter a soft-lock because of the mod 💦
  
- `D-Pad Left` - ✨ Set Pose Preset ✨ This button captures your character's current animation and frame, allowing you to 'freeze' yourself in that position later if you have a particular pose you want to be squished in.
  
- `D-Pad Right` - ✨ Toggle Preset Pose On/Off ✨ This button will toggle "Pose Mode," a mode that will lock your character in whichever animation and frame you selected earlier with the **Set Pose Preset** button. This is a way for you to more easily squish yourself in whichever pose you like! I'd like to expand on this feature in the future to make it easier to select the exact animation, frame, and angle you want to be squished in as well.

- `Squish+ Mod Menu` - ✨ Modify Your Squishing Experience ✨ From the SM64 DX pause menu (Accessed with Pause -> Right-Bumper, Defaults are Spacebar -> Right Shift), you'll see a button labelled either `Squish+` or `Mod Menu`. Entering this menu will give you access to a bunch of customization options for the mod!

Feel free to use additional mods in tandem with this one! However, I suggest sticking to level mods (such as the pre-installed Star Road mod), or [character mods](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/categories/custom-characters.4/) for the smoothest experience! I've only tested compatibility with a [small handful of behavior mods](#-compatible-mods).

If you're able to consistently replicate a bug, don't hesitate to [fill out a bug report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScznpjr9QTrfvurq5ktppkQWYIKzjsfdZWjz0u9a9tsZkZtcQ/viewform?usp=header) with reproduction steps, it helps me a lot! Just make sure to read the [bug reporting guide](#-bug-reporting-guide) first!
<br/><br/>

## 🐛 Bug Reporting Guide
[Reporting bugs](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScznpjr9QTrfvurq5ktppkQWYIKzjsfdZWjz0u9a9tsZkZtcQ/viewform?usp=header) you come across helps me make this mod as enjoyable as possible! This guide exists to explain how best to go about reporting issues you find! Before you spend time filing a report, check out the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/89uM80j1/squish), as it's possible the bug is already in the process of being fixed!

There's no 'correct' way to fill out a report, but including enough details for me to replicate the bug on my own computer is a good rule of thumb! Here are two examples of great bug reports:
```
When I throw a Chuckya while standing right up against a ledge, the game teleports me to the ground below and squishes me.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Go to Tall Tall Mountain
2. Pick up the Chuckya
3. Get as close to the ledge as you can
4. Turn to face away from the ledge
5. Throw the Chuckya
```
This report includes a helpful description of the issue and reproduction steps, making it a lot easier for me to reproduce the issue!  
<br/>
```
I keep getting softlocked whenever I exit the boo level while squished. It happens every time I press 'exit level' while flat.
```
Keeping things short and sweet like this is completely fine as well! As long as there's enough information for me to attempt to replicate the bug, it's a great bug report!
<br/>
<br/>

### What Qualifies as a Bug?
I realize what does and does not qualify as a bug is very subjective, so I put together a few questions to help you decide if it's worth spending your time filing a report or not!

If the answer is `yes` to any of these, I would consider it a bug!
- Does the character behave in a way that doesn't make sense for the mod? (For example: Pressing the `Self Squish Button` button jumps you all the way to the **ceiling** instead of the **floor**)
- Is there a de-sync between you and another player? (For example: Player 2 sees themselves squished to a Thwomp, but you see Player 2 squished to a completely different Thwomp)
- Are you forced to use the `Hard Restore Button` to break out of a soft-lock? (For example: You are unable to exit a level while flat, and have to pop into shape using the `Hard Restore Button` before you're allowed to exit)
- Is this an issue caused by how the player interacts with a piece of geometry? (For example: In the 'Star Road' mod, squishing yourself to the floating wooden platform on level 3 forces you to a 45 degree angle)
<br/>

On the flipside, if the answer is `yes` to any of these questions, I would `not` consider it a bug!
- Is this issue related to button mappings between this mod and another mod? (For example: Pressing the `Hard Restore Button` also turns on `Invincibility` mode in the `DevTools` mod)
- Is this an issue related to how a specific character's animations or model interact with the mod? (For example: The `Bowser` player model clips through the ground if squished during the ground pound animation)
<br/>

If you're unsure if something qualifies as a bug or not, feel free to [submit a bug report](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScznpjr9QTrfvurq5ktppkQWYIKzjsfdZWjz0u9a9tsZkZtcQ/viewform?usp=header) anyway! I'd prefer an excess of reports as opposed to no reports at all! Lastly, thank you for taking the time to read this guide, and thank you in advance if you end up filing a bug report!

## ✨ What's New
### v1.07.1
<sup>11/17/2025</sup>
- Fixed a bug where players could splat when falling from high heights on Koopa Shells and while using Crazy Boxes
- Fixed a bug where players sometimes wouldn't get squished in their pose-preset pose

### v1.07
<sup>11/16/2025</sup>

With this update comes a new feature, quality of life changes, and optimizations to the code! I strongly suggest that you **switch the Interpolation Settings under `Options -> Display` to `Fast` if it isn't already!** This fixes the rubberbanding issue that occurs when getting squished or restoring!
- 🎊 New Restore Animation! 🎊 Players will now spring back into shape in a much more cartoony and satisfying way upon restoring! Players can modify this setting in the Squish+ menu under "Restore Animation Duration". Values range from 0 (default SM64 restore animation) to 1 (more drawn out version of the custom animation), with 0.75 being the default value. Be sure to mess with this value and see which you like the most!
- Players now compress all the way down before they actually enter the squished state! Prior to this, players would jump from about 30% height down to about 0.5% height very quickly, causing a weird looking squish visual!
- Adjusted conditions required to be squished by an interactable object: The player must now be close to the ground to get squished, and the object must get close to colliding with the ground to spread the player!
- Giant Goombas can now squish the player!
- Bug Fixes, including issues with connecting / disconnecting from a lobby, players getting stuck in the ceiling when squishing into it, a Grindel themed soft lock, and errors that players would sometimes see when loading into a server!


### v1.06.2
<sup>11/10/2025</sup>
- Fixed bug where players couldn't spread while stuck to walls!
- Fixed mod version number!

### v1.06
<sup>11/10/2025</sup>
- 🎊 Wall Squishes! 🎊 Players can now get squished into walls under a select few conditions! Squishing from flying into a wall with the Wing Cap will be added soon! Let me know what other Wall Squishes you'd like to see!
  - Shooting yourself from a cannon into a wall or a ceiling will now squish you to the surface!
  - Hitting your friends with enough force into a wall or a ceiling can squish them! I suggest enabling `Too Much` knockback in the server settings to see this in full effect!
- Can now use the Animation Set and Animation Pose feature on Custom Animations! This should cover all non-model-changing animations! Examples include Bowser's fire breath animation, Character Select Princess animations, and dancing mods such as the [Gangnam Style Mod](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/l-button-to-gangnam-style.865/)! I hope you'll enjoy the new possible squish poses this opens up!

The wall squishes bring on a whole new dimension to being squished, but with that comes a couple of bugs! Including shooting yourself out of a cannon onto a rotating object causing your rotation to flip the wrong way, and getting squished to a ceiling sometimes latching you onto the wrong surface! As always, feel free to let me know if you encounter anything and I'll try and get it patched as soon as possible!
<br/>

### v1.05
<sup>11/08/2025</sup>
- Sound Effect Updates!
  - Added 4 New Recovery Sounds, and 1 New Squish Sound, courtesy of [Epic Umbreon](https://bsky.app/profile/epicflatbreon.bsky.social)!
  - Adjusted levels on all the sounds so they should be roughly the same volume now!
  - Players can now add their own sounds! To put your own custom sounds into the mod, do the following steps once you've downloaded the [latest version of squish-plus](https://github.com/SalmonSlack/squish-plus/blob/main/squish-plus.zip):
    - Un-zip `squish-plus.zip` and open the `Sounds` folder
    - Add or remove files to your liking, just make sure they are `.ogg` or `.mp3` files, and make sure they follow the restore_`NUMBER` or splat_`NUMBER` format! (You can have up to 10 restore sounds and 10 splat sounds, numbered 0 - 9! If people want more sound capacity I can add that later!)
    - Re-zip `squish-plus.zip` and drag it directly into your game window, and the mod should now pull from the sounds you've added!

Aside from new sounds, I've been digging deeper into a couple of tickets to see if certain ideas are feasible or if certain bugs can be fixed, namely these two: [Leave Behind Models on Respawn](https://trello.com/c/adJATcTD/34-dark-souls-style-mode-w-flat-models-left-behind-on-respawn) and [Custom Pose Squishing](https://trello.com/c/ygkXN3yz/12-custom-character-animations-default-to-standard-mario-animations-while-squished-and-during-pose-setting). I'd like to dive deeper into the former ticket a bit more in the coming weeks, but for now I want to prioritize stuff like [Wall Squishes](https://trello.com/c/qD6Ifm2k/3-wall-squishes) and [Additional Interactions](https://trello.com/c/6nEiqn53/4-additional-squish-interactions-w-world-objects-and-players), so keep your eyes peeled for those!

### v1.04.1
<sup>11/06/2025</sup>
- The pretty major bug of randomly teleporting to different surfaces should mostly be a thing of the past! You can now squish easy knowing you won't be shot across the map! The issue was most prominent when you squished from a high height or got run over by an object while near the 'seam' between two surfaces!
-  Attempting to set a pose-preset while 'Smearing Effects' are turned off should no longer mess with the characters light and shading values outside of the initial blink effect!

### v1.04
<sup>11/06/2025</sup>
- New Squish Interactions!
  - Koopa the Quick can now run you over and land on top of you
  - Racing Penguin can now slide over you
  - Landing on another player with the bouncing box squishes them
 With these new interactions, it has become increasingly important to address the bug where players jump to a seemingly random part of the terrain when getting squished, so pending any new bugs from this update, that'll be my main focus from a bug-fixing standpoint!

- Your mod settings can now be saved across play sessions with the use of 'Profiles!' It's admittedly a bit clunky due to current limitations with modding SM64 Co-op DX, but I hope it gets the job done!
  1. Open the `Squish+ Mod Menu` and adjust all the sliders to your preferred settings
  2. Scroll over to the last page
  3. Enter a `Profile Name` and hit `Save Profile`
  4. Next time you host or join a game with Squish+ enabled, the settings should automatically be applied!

You can also create as many profiles as you'd like! To do this, follow the same steps as above, only this time, make sure to name the profile something different! You can switch between profiles by pressing the `Switch Profile` button, just keep an eye out on the bottom left of your screen to make sure you're selecting the right one! Unfortunately, it doesn't seem possible to do a live update of the `Profile Name` and all the values when you press the `Switch Profile` button, so for now I suggest closing and backing out of the menu and re-opening it before you edit the profile you switch to!

The `Delete ALL Profiles` button exists as a failsafe in case you're unable to delete a profile! Let me know if you encounter any issues with the normal `Delete Profile` button. I'll ultimately remove this global delete once I feel confident we don't need a failsafe!

And thank you for all the support around this mod! It's really been so much fun getting to work on this and share it with people! 🧡
  
<br/>

### v1.03.1
- Removed an unused variable that was causing errors
<br/>

### v1.03
11/04/2025
- Landing on players from a high height (or with a metal cap) will now squish the player you land on! Careful not to land on other players from TOO high up though...
- The [FreeCamera](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/freecamera.457/) Mod is now compatible with Squish+!
- Fixed a couple of Thwomp specific bugs
<br/>

### v1.02.1 - (11/04/2025)
- Fixed a bug that prevented players from restoring when squished by a moving surface
<br/>

### v1.02 - (11/03/2025)
- Fixed some issues with the `Minimum Squish Duration` variable, making how long players must wait before restoration more consistent!
- Added `Enable Smearing Effect` toggle to the mod menu. This is a local variable to let players to turn on/off the lighting effects that occur when you get spread! 
- Added new options the host can access that apply to the whole server!
  - `Squish Damage` - This affects the base damage enemies will deal on squish. Ranges from 0 - 8, with 8 being a one-shot KO! 'Heavier' enemies like King Whomp have a damage multiplier behind the scenes, so keep that in mind! Default value is `2 Damage`
  - `PvP Squish Damage` - This affects how much damage a player will deal to another player when they ground pound them! Ranges from 0 - 8, with a default value of `0 Damage`
  - `Enable D-Pad Actions` - This toggles the ability for players to use the `Squish Self`, `Set Preset`, and `Toggle Preset Mode` buttons! Default value is `TRUE`
  - `Minimum Squish Duration` - This value indicates how long players must remain flat for before being able to restore. Keep in mind that higher values can effectively stun-lock you with certain enemies, and this number does not apply to surface objects like `Thwomps` to help avoid true stun-locks. Default value is `1 Second`
  - `Enable Auto Restore` - This toggle automatically restores a player as soon as they hit their `Minimum Squish Duration`. Default value is `FALSE`
  - `Invincibility Timer` - This value determines how long a player stays immune to damage once they restore. (Surface Objects can still squish you while invincibile!) Values range from 0.0 to 3.0 seconds incrementing by 0.5, with a default value of `1 Second`
<br/>

### v1.01 - (11/02/2025)
- Replaced `Custom Sound Effects` toggle with a `Custom Sound Volume` slider!
<br/>

### v1.0 - (11/01/2025)
- 🎊 Official Release! 🎊
<br/><br/>

## 🕑 Reverting
If you find yourself wanting to return to an old version of the mod, you can follow these steps to get the old version back on your system!
1. Navigate to `squish-plus.zip` [history page](https://github.com/SalmonSlack/squish-plus/commits/main/squish-plus.zip)
2. Click on one of the titles, this should take you to a new page
3. Click the three dots towards the right of the page, and click `View File`
4. Enter `Ctrl-Shift-S` or click the three dots towards the right of the page and click `Download`
5. Open SM64 Co-op Deluxe
6. Drag the `squish-plus.zip` file directly into your game window
7. This should automatically update your mod to the version you just downloaded!

## 🧩 Mod Compatibility
I'll add onto this list as I do more testing, but for now, assume any character mods and level packs are compatible, and any behavior altering mods `not` listed here are semi-incompatible or incompatible!

### ✅ Compatible Mods
- [Free Camera](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/freecamera.457/): I recommend adding this mod to your game in case you ever want to capture a specific angle you can't otherwise get with the vanilla camera!
- [Noclip](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/noclip.30/)
- [King's DevTools](https://mods.sm64coopdx.com/mods/kings-devtools.339/): Default button mappings use the D-Pad, which causes the actions from `Squish+` and `DevTools` to happen at the same time. (e.g. `D-Pad Down` squishes you AND opens the map select menu) This can be fixed by having the server host disable the `D-Pad Actions` mod option.

### ⚠️ Semi-Compatible Mods
- Arena: Lots of issues and unexpected behaviors when interacting with this mode, however the host options hopefully help offset some of the glaring problems! I would like to explore the possibility of making this mode more compatible with Squish+ in future updates!

### ❌ Incompatible Mods
